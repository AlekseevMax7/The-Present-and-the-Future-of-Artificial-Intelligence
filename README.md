Selected quotes and recommended approaches in the work:

1.	AI Autonomy and adaptability: Develop flexible AI systems capable of self-learning and decision adjustment based on new data.
"Current AI systems are already capable of complex tasks such as pattern recognition or voice control, but future developments will allow them to act even more independently."
"Instead of being tied to certain conditions or programs, AI will be able to independently adapt to new situations and changes."

2.	Benefits of AI implementation: Deploy AI technologies in areas that improve efficiency and reduce human error while ensuring oversight and safety.
"The use of AI allows to reduce labor costs, increases the accuracy of task performance and helps to save time."
"The development of robotic surgeons allows complex operations to be performed with high precision and minimal error."

3.	Challenges and responsibility: Implement standards and auditing of AI systems.
"We must keep in mind the importance of ethics and safety when creating such systems. Only in this way will we be able to fully reveal the potential of AI for the good of society."
